A problem a day keeps the headache away.

##### Compile code:
```
g++ solution.cpp

(Another note: In the interest of my personal time, solutions for
`leetcode` problems are checked in as is without handling
input/output and header files.)

##### Running compiled code:
```
./a.out
```

##### Commit message format:
```
[Problem: <problem_number>] - <solution_approach_in_a_line>
