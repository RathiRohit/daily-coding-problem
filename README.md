> A problem a day keeps the headache away.

#### Note:
- Some solutions written in C++ might be using C++11 features.
  In such case compile the code with `-std=c++11` flag. 
- Solutions written in JS will have their own package.json files.
  Make sure to install all dependencies before executing code with
  `npm start`.
- You need to come up with your own inputs, if `input.txt` file is
  not present in corresponding problem directory.
- In the interest of my personal time, solutions for `leetcode`
  problems are checked in as is without handling input/output and
  header files.
