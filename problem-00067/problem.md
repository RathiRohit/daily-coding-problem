Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive,
return all possible letter combinations that the number
could represent. Return the answer in any order.

Mapping of digit to letters is just like on the telephone buttons.

For ex.

`2 => ['a', 'b', 'c']`

`9 => ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']`

Example 1:
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

Constraints:
```
0 <= digits.length <= 4
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].
```
