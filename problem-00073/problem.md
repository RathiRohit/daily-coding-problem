A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid.

The robot can only move either `down` or `right` at any point in
time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the
grid.

How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

Example 3:
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

Example 4:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.
```
