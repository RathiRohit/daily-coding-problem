The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even
offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation.
They offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your
expense report that meet the same criteria.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```

The three entries that sum to `2020` are `979, 366, and 675`.
Multiplying them together produces the answer, `241861950`.

In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries
that sum to `2020`?
