Problem: 55
---
An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list.

Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields,
it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node
and the previous node.

Implement an XOR linked list;

it has an `addToEnd(element)` which adds the element to the end 

& a `get(index)` which returns the node at the index.
